"""
You have N versions of a software, we want to
find that the first "bad" version of the
software

How to determine a bad version?

We will be given a method called "isBadVersion" 
by default, it returns a boolean, true if the 
version you pass to it is bad,
false otherwise

Important note:
if a version is bad, all versions after it are bad

Can our input be "0", meaning that we have no versions
of our software?

No, our input, N, will represent versions starting
from [1...N] and we'll never have N be 0
